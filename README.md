## The Product
The idea is that you create a Node, give it a Title and Description and connect a Line to another Node. Repeat this process to form a tree of tasks to complete.

You can:
* Create new Nodes
* Edit Title and Detail Text
* Connect the Nodes together with Lines
* Move the Nodes around
* Save the Project


Planned features:
* Create projects like in Visual Studio with multiple files
* Add Alt-Text to Lines (named connections)
* Link external files to Nodes
* Multiple Tabs (Scene, NodeEditing, (like in Microsoft Teams: Post, Class Notebook, ...))
* Externally modded Tabs (technically the ability to program a game as a mod)

You can find the full documentation on the [wiki](https://github.com/CAt0mIcS/NodePlanningEditor/wiki) (soon).
