## The Product
The idea is that you create a Node, give it a Title and Description and connect a Line to another Node. Repeat this process to form a tree of tasks to complete.

You can:
* Create new Nodes
* Edit Title and Detail Text
* Connect the Nodes together with Lines
* Move the Nodes around
* Save the Scene
* Open another Save File
* Open multiple Tabs (Different Save Files)

You can find the full documentation on the [wiki](https://github.com/CAt0mIcS/NodePlanningEditor/wiki) (soon).
